Instructions for installing and using War Thunder assistant on Windows:

1) Install Python from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   in the installation process, make sure to check the "add python to PATH" on the bottom and I recommend just choosing "install now" instead of custom installation

2) Open Command Prompt and run these commands:
   "pip install pyautogui"
   "pip install playsound==1.2.2"
   "pip install keyboard"
   
3) Download "alert.wav" from the home page to the "downloads" folder (any .wav or .mp3 sound file will work)

4) Copy and paste "warthunder_assist.py" into any code editor (notepad will do, just make sure to change the file from a .txt file to a .py file
by right clicking on the file and clicking "rename"

5) In order for the sound alert to work, you will need to follow the instructions in the user configurations section. The only thing you really need to change is the
   sound path and the "mute" keybind in the IMPORTANT section at the top.

6) Configure settings in the user configuration section to your preference

7) Run the file by double clicking on the notepad file or by running "python whatever_you_named_the_file.py" in command prompt. If you run the program with the command,
   the file needs to be in C:\Users\User
